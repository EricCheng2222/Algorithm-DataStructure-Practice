# Algorithm-DataStructure-Practice
An algorithm a day keeps your fresh mind awake.
This is a spontaneous practicing plan to practice and reconstruct
those algorithm and data structure I've learned before or will learn in the future.
Note.
Each algorithm, datastructure is ready to serve.
Just remove the main function (test) and pack it into .hpp file,
and use the predefined macro.
