Fourier Transform usually refers to a transformation
that maps a temporal domain function to frequency domain.
Because it is an integral transform, it gives us some properties
that we can take advantage of.

For instance, convolution in one domain are corresponding to 
the multiplication of the other domain.

Here we know that there's also a discrete version of fourier transform.
We called it Discrete Fourier Transform (or DFT). Usually a DFT cost O(n^2).
however, Fast Fourier Transform (or FFT) algorithms provides us O(n log n)
efficiency by using divide and counquer.
