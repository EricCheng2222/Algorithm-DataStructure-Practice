This is a sorting function, heap sort.
It supplies iterators with random access.
Time complexity of it is O(nlogn)
Memory complexity of it is O(1) because it is inplace sorting.
It is an unstable sort.
Definition of "operator<" is required for proper sorting.
Furthermore "operator<" must be defined under a strict ordering relation
in order that the sort will operate correctly.
The sort was based on a few operation of a binary heap.
First we max-heapify the inputted array.
Then we deconstruct the heap by multiple deletion from the top of the heap.
Finally we will have a sorted array that is increasing.
