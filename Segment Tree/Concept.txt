This is a generic container template, polymorphic version of segment tree.
Operator+ is must be defined in O(1) and also assiciative.
Three core methods are build, update as well as query.
The build method has interface "build(begin, end)"
where begin and end must be random-accesssible and operate is an
associative binary operation under specified type.
Time and memory complexity of the build method is O(n).
Update method is designed to update a segment part's value;
It has time complexity O(log n).
Query method is designed to generate the segment operation for a
specified segment, with time complexity O(log n).
However, if the length of the segment operated is 1, the unique element
in that segment will be returned.
It has time complexity O(log n).

Lazy tag was used.
Particulary, mark that we use [begin,end) notation to describe a segment.
