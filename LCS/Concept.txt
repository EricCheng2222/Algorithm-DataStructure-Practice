This is a Dynamic Programing solution to count the
length of a Longest Common Sequence,
with time Complexity O(nm) and memory Complexity O(nm)
where n and m refers to the length of two sequence inputted.
To operate correctly, two are required.
    1. "operator<" defined under a strict ordering relation.
    2. container inputted must contain size() member function.
