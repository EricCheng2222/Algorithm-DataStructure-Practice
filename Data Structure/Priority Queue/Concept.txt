This is a Priority Queue I wrote.
The time complexity of its operation is roughly the same as "std::priority_queue."
(with respect to big-O notation)
We construct the priority queue mainly by construct a binary heap within.
The push() and pop() operation takes O(log n).
The top() operation takes constant though.
To compile correctly for any instantialtion of the template class,
"Operator<" of the value type must be defined and defined within a strict ordering relation
also in order that its basic operations perform properly.
